            Nature is an important and integral part of mankind.<br>
            It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. <br>
            Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. <br>
            This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. <br>
            They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, <br>
            nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe,<br> 
            the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more.<br>
            Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. <br>
            Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.
